 KEY INSIGHT:

The total annual sales for Kurl Enterprise in 2018 amounted to $267K, with February being the highest sales month ($36,286).

There was a significant dip in sales after February, with the lowest sales recorded in December ($16,647).

The West region contributed the most to the company's revenue, accounting for 37.78% of total sales. Furniture where bought there while offices supplies where the least bought product there.

Grant Thornton was the highest-spending customer, contributing $8,167 in sales.

 RECOMMENDATIONS:

The noticeable decline in sales after February suggests a need for seasonal promotions or marketing strategies to boost mid-year and year-end sales. Consider launching campaigns or discounts during slower months like April and December.

More products can be taken to the West that suit their demand and also those products which are least there can be taken to other regions where people buy them more. Also communication can be made with these retailers to get their feedback on other non performing products to know the reasons they do not perform well with them.

Since Grant Thornton is the top customer, create loyalty or VIP programs for high-spending customers to keep them engaged and incentivized to continue purchasing. Also, analyze other top customers for similar opportunities.
